# Individual Contributor License Agreement

_In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Specter Ops
must have a Contributor License Agreement (“**Agreement**”) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating
agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of
Specter Ops, Inc. as project manager (the “**Project Manager**”) and the Project users; it does not change your rights
to use your own Contributions for any other purpose._

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the
Project Manager. Except for the license granted herein to the Project Manager and recipients of software distributed by
the Project Manager, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. **Definitions.**
  </br></br>
  "**You**" (or "**Your**") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the
  copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Project Manager. 
  </br></br>
  "**Contribution**" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship, including any
  modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Manager for
  inclusion in, or documentation of any of the projects owned, managed, distributed or made available by the
  Project Manager (the "**Work**"). For the purposes of this definition, "**submitted**" means any form of electronic,
  verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Manager or its representatives, including but not limited to
  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by,
  or on behalf of, the Project Manager for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
  that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. **Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
  Project Manager and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Manager a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
  no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. **Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
  Project Manager and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Manager a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
  no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this Section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer
  to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
  Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
  litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
  then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as
  of the date such litigation is filed. 

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to
  intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, You represent that you have received
  permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your
  Contributions to the Project Manager, or that your employer has executed a separate Contributor License Agreement with
  the Project Manager.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 7 for submissions on behalf of
  others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other
  restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and
  which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support.
  You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
  You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the Project Manager
  separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other
  restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are
  personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify the Project Manager of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these
  representations inaccurate in any respect.
